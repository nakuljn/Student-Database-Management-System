# Student-Database-Management-System
Here we are making an student database management system in c++. We will be doing this with the help of file handling. 

Some features of this project are
1. Student Login : Student can login and view their record (cgpa, marks in subjects);
2. Admin Login : Admin can view the records, delete a record or add a new record (loginid = "abcd",  pass = "efgh");
3. Instructor Login : Instructor can change the marks of a particular subject;
